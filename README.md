# PyTest
This Python code is a test suite for a slide puzzle game. It uses the pytest framework to run the tests. The tests are organized into a class called 'TestSlidePuzzle'.

Summary of each test:

1. 'test_getStartingBoard': This test checks the 'getStartingBoard' function. It asserts that the returned board has the correct dimensions (BOARDWIDTH x BOARDHEIGHT) and that the blank tile is in the correct position (bottom right corner).

2. 'test_isValidMove': This test checks the 'isValidMove' function. It asserts that certain moves are valid or invalid based on the initial state of the board.

3. 'test_makeMove': This test checks the 'makeMove' function. It asserts that the blank tile moves to the correct position when a move is made.

4. 'test_getRandomMove': This test checks the 'getRandomMove' function. It asserts that the function returns a valid move (UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT).

The 'if __name__ == "__main__":' line at the end of the script allows the script to be run directly from the command line, which will run the pytest tests.

In summary, this code is a set of unit tests for a slide puzzle game. It checks that the game's functions behave as expected under certain conditions.
